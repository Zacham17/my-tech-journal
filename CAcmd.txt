1. Run dhclient to request ip address (may take a moment)

2. Type "ip addr" to see if you have an IP - write down IP for later. "ping -c1 google.com" for good measure.

3. Install Apache/httpd with: yum install -y httpd   (may take a moment)

4. You need to allow http through the firewall: firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=80/tcp

5. Reload firewall config: firewall-cmd --reload

6. Verify that firewall is open: firewall-cmd --query-port=80/tcp (should report "yes")

7. Start the httpd service: systemctl start httpd

8. Let's check the current Apache status: systemctl status httpd





on CA

cd /etc/pki/CA
touch index.txt
echo 1000 > serial

openssl genrsa -des3 -out private/cakey.pem 2048

openssl req -new x509 -days 365 -key private/cakey.pem -out cacert.pem


On WEB

openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout websrv.key -out websrv.csr
scp websrv.csr USER@CAHOST


On CA

openssl ca -out websrv.crt -infiles websrv.csr
scp websrv.csr USER@WEBHOST


HTTPS

On your CentOS Web Server - make sure to copy the files into the following locations:
Web Server certificate: /etc/pki/tls/certs
Web server private key: /etc/pki/tls/private
2. Install mod-ssl for Apache

yum -y install mod_ssl
3. Update /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf

Find SSLCertificateFile and make sure the path and filename match your certificate file
Find SSLCertificateKeyFile and make sure the path and filename match your key file
Save file
4. Update firewall to allow port 443 - reload firewall

5. Restart httpd

6. Browse to your server using HTTPS - You should have success
